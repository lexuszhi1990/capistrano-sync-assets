Capistrano Assets sync
======================

a easy way to synchronize assets between local and remote. by default, it will backup the current asset by rename it end with 'bak'(eg, change 'system' to 'system_bak'), and delete the previous backup.
It only works with capistrano 3.

Usage
=======

#### In your Gemfile:
Add it to Gemfile on development group

```ruby
  gem 'capistrano-sync-assets', require: false, group: :development
```

#### In your Capfile:

```ruby
require 'capistrano/sync/assets'
```

#### In your `deploy.rb` or `deploy/production.rb` or other environment deploy config
set the sync dirs, such as 'public/uploads', 'public/system'. NOTE that these dirs should be existed in `linked_dirs`, which means that this gem only sync the dirs in **shared/** directory.

```ruby
  set :sync_assets_dirs, fetch(:sync_assets_dirs, []).push('public/uploads')
```

then you can sync the assets between your local machine and server.

```
cap sync:assets:pull # Synchronize your local assets using remote assets
cap sync:assets:push # Synchronize your remote assets using local assets
```
